		<p>The reBin is a recycled recycling bin. It is an exercise in design poetics. Like all design could be.</p>
		<p>Making can be a therapeutic process. This idea was emphasised well by David Gauntlett in his book, Making is Connecting.</p>
		<p>On the day I designed this bin I was feeling a little like trash, and I happened to have a nice crisp sheet of cardboard courtesy of some furniture packaging. So like the poet I want to be, I put my heart into a recycling bin made of recycled cardboard that I had up-cycled from packaging.</p>
		<p>Out came the callipers, on went SolidWorks. Eight hours later my design was ready for the laser cutter. Thanks to Dassault Systems and to Ravensbourne for the opportunity to up-cycle some recycled paper into a paper recycling bin.</p>
		<p>Laser cut from recycled cardboard, the bin assembles without folds or glue. And it looks good, with crisp lasered lines and neat interlocking parts. It lasted about a year and a half. It's time to cut a new one.</p>
