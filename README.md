# What is this?
This is my website, I first coded in 2012, so it's looking pretty long in the tooth in terms of code. It was created at a time when web development meant opening your code editor, adding jQuery from your CDN and you were away. I am in the process of updating this site. However new content showing recent work is my priority. 

When the site is updated it will use a 12 col-grid based on Bourbon SCSS but will remain a static HTML site for the sake of simplicity. More complex code will exist in the form of other projects, both professional and personal.
