		<p>Hi there! Thanks for visiting my site.</p>
		<p>I am a front-end/JavaScript engineer and multidisciplinary creative.</p>
		<p>I enjoy making in a range of materials and for a range of media. My bread and butter is high-quality front-ends and data visualisation.</p>
		<p>I believe products should be designed to be in harmony with their usersâ€™ cognition, emotions and environment.</p>
		<p>My principle art, design and technology heroes are Marcel Duchamp, Richard Hamilton, Bill Lear, Buckminster Fuller, Mike Bostock and Douglass Crockford.</p>
		<p>I started my career as a journalist and have previously worked as a Producer for Associated Press Television News. I have produced and presented radio, written scripts for documentaries and web video, and have written for print and online. </p>
		<p>My background in journalism helps me focus on what products communicate to the user.</p>
		<p>I have an MA, where I earned a Distinction for research remixing documentary journalism with the interactive possibilities of mobile devices.</p>
		<p>You can contact me via email at <a href=mailto:stefan.christou@gmail.com>stefan.christou@gmail.com</a>.</p>
		<p>I live in east London.</p>
		<p>My cat is called Michael.</p>
