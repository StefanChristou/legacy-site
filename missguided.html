		<p>This concept was created as part of a pitch for advertising revenue from the online fashion retailer Missguided. It was created as part of my role as a Digital Designer in the Creative Solutions department of Ad-Network InSkin Media. I took the lead on this project, creating the concept, flats and video along with slides for the pitch presentation. </p>

		<p>I was working without assets or a clear brief from the client. The work was intended to show a possible solution for using Missguided’s existing branding within Inskin’s high-impact HTPO-style tablet format. The target ad-spend was £100,000.</p>

		<p>I approached this project by first immersing myself in the Missguided brand. I collected assets and built mood boards. It became clear that the brand uses impactful graphical elements with hints of occult and a 1990s NY-style mixed with bright, high-contrast and sometimes low-fi photography in locations reminiscent of Miami or Ibiza. The brand’s strapline “Peace, Love and Fashion” hints at Boho and decadent themes. If Missguided’s customer looked at art it would be by Andy Warhol, Richard Hamilton and Daido Moriyama. Ideally Missguided’s customer sees herself as young, hot and dangerous. She listens to Lana Del Ray in the day and Extravelt at night. Her device is a Rose Gold iPhone, she spends her time on Instagram. She wants a picture of herself looking hot drinking champaign in the VIP area or enjoying the beach with her friends.</p>

		<p>This sunny, trippy, and ‘edgy’ style prompted me to take a fine-art approach to fitting Missguided’s existing content into the HTPO-ad content-area. I created a collage of popular pieces from their Spring/Summer collection and created a kaleidoscope-like composition in After Effects. This creates a highly-impactful background to the creative that is constantly drawing the customer’s eye, showcasing the content in view. When the user scrolls the page or interacts with the creative, the featured product changes and the area in view and the kaleidoscope pans to show the product.</p>

		<p>Multiple CTAs allow users to navigate to the product directly from the creative, or to Missguided’s campaign landing pages.</p>
